# Max-Flow Min-Cut Image Segmentation 

Project Overview

This project applies the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem to segment grayscale images by separating the foreground from the background. The goal is to build a tool that efficiently segments images by leveraging network flow optimization techniques. This method is particularly useful in scenarios requiring precise object delineation, such as medical imaging, automated image editing, and computer vision applications.

Key Files

•	Optimization_project1 (2).ipynb: Contains the implementation of the segmentation algorithm using the max-flow min-cut theorem, including the necessary imports, image processing, and Gurobi optimization steps.
•	Optimization Project 1.pdf: A detailed report explaining the background, theory, and implementation of the segmentation algorithm, including images, code chunks, and graphs. The report is written from the perspective of a startup competing with Photoshop and outlines the benefits and limitations of using this method for image segmentation.
•	example_images/: A folder containing example grayscale images (box.csv, oval-1.csv, and additional synthetic images) that can be used to test the algorithm.
